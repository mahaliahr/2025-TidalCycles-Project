# 2025-TidalCycles-Project

Hello & Welcome to the 2025 version of the excitingly titled 'Tidal Cycles Project'

---

aims:
continue to practice making algorithmic music with Tidal Cycles (and often probably making visuals with Hydra alongside them too.)

This year I want to play more with a sense of liveness and break the pratice out of purely me working on things in private. I will try to do this in the most low stakes and understated way that I can, in what I am currently calling the 'performance to no-one' series where I will livestream what ever I am working on and see what happens...
